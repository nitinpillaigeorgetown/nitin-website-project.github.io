- Notes To Professor
      - I have tried to recreate my startup - GX Partners' website, which I had founded in 2017.
      - I had used a basic HTML template from Aria Themes back then. This company is now defunct, and hence I couldn't link to the company page. The following template is almost completely customized from scratch.
      - I wanted to add multiple pages (Terms, Privacy Policy, etc), and a "Projects" section, which I couldn't, due to time constraints.
      - I have linked a Google Form to the "Contact Us" button.
      - I have added SEO elements (Meta Title, Description, Keywords etc) to the header.
      - The site has been built to be completely responsive.
